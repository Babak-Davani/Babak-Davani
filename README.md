## 😊 About Me

🔍 As a dedicated and insightful Data Scientist, I bring a unique blend of healthcare expertise and advanced data science skills to the table. My journey began in the medical field, During my time at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, I achieved my MD and subsequently became a board-certified Anesthesiologist. This pivotal phase in my career was characterized by active participation in various clinical research teams, leading to significant contributions to peer-reviewed publications in the medical field.

📊 Transitioning into the realm of data science, I have effectively utilized my skills in R, Python, and machine learning to drive data-driven solutions in healthcare and education sectors. My work as a Data Analyst in Canada has seen me develop robust data pipelines, engage in sophisticated social network analysis, and create dynamic visualizations to aid decision-making processes.

💡 My passion lies in harnessing the power of data to uncover insights and guide informed decisions. With my foundation in research methodology and a keen eye for data-driven approaches, I am committed to leveraging my expertise to revolutionize patient care and tackle new challenges across various industries.
